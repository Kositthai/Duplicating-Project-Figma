[LINK TO APP](https://duplicating-project-figma.vercel.app/)

A clone of a mountain landing webpage using HTML and CSS. The design was inspired by a resource from Figma, which can be accessed at https://www.figma.com/file/KzkU2ciCZbSyFuiDk1ycbk/mountain-landing-(Community)?node-id=0-1&t=aQMKFnao18PHshs3-0.

The webpage features a navigation bar, a hero section with a background image and text overlay, a section with three columns, a section with four columns, a section with a form, a section with a large image, and a footer. The design was closely replicated using HTML and CSS code.
